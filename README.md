# Gravity
Fall 2020 Project using PyGame in Python

DESCRIPTION
----------------

Gravity is a puzzle-platformer game that I made in Fall 2020 using the PyGame module, which uses Python code. In this game, you want to reach checkpoints of every level using your controls and powerups. You control two players, a main character and a puppy, both of which can be used to activate different tools and pressure plates to solve puzzles in order to proceed to the next level. The key to the game however, is in pressing 'G', which flips the gravity! This can be used for all sorts of other platforming gimmicks, involving things like visualizing the level upside-down.
